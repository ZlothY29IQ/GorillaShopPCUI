Remake of a popular mod called Gorilla Shop Except its on your pc with some bonus features! Shows your fps, your shiny rocks. Direct purchase buttons which are colour coded based on their price (green = you can afford, red = cant afford, blue = free). You can search for specific cosmetics too.

NOTE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL COSMETICS LOADING YOUR GAME WILL LAG A TON.
I'm slowly working on making it not lag. If you fix it before I do feel free to open a pull request!
